This Project is a work in progress...

Right now I have a Shell, programmed in C that accepts some built-in commands. (pwd, help,copy files, and exit)
Working on the part for forking and executing other executable programs. Creating my PATH and executing the desired program.

I Will implement a standard in and standard out and a pipeline.
